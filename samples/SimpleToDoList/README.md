# SimpleToDoList

This project is based on [Avalonia.Samples/SimpleToDoList](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.Samples/tree/main/src/Avalonia.Samples/CompleteApps/SimpleToDoList).
With addition of mobile and browser projects, as well as some extra feature used for illustrations and documentation.

## Running

This project already has everything set-up to run `Developer Tools`, except configured NuGet.Config.
You need to edit `<YOUR_PORTAL_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_PORTAL_LICENSE_KEY>` as per [Getting Started](../../docs/getting-started.md).

With that done, projects can be run as normally.

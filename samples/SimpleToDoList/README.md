# SimpleToDoList

This project is based on [Avalonia.Samples/SimpleToDoList](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.Samples/tree/main/src/Avalonia.Samples/CompleteApps/SimpleToDoList).
With addition of mobile and browser projects, as well as some extra feature used for illustrations and documentation.

## Running

This project already has everything set-up to run `Developer Tools`.

But tool itself still needs to be installed. See [Getting Started](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/accelerate/tools/dev-tools/getting-started) for details.

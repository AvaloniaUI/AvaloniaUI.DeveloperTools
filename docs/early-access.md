# Early Access

## Setup

At the moment, early access users don't have access to the portal licensing.
To workaround that, Developer Tools setup is slightly different.

Users should receive several credentials:
- NuGet feed username and password. Where login is used as `<YOUR_PORTAL_USERNAME>` and password as `<YOUR_PORTAL_LICENSE_KEY>` from [Step 1: Prepare NuGet feed](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#step-1-prepare-nuget-feed)
- Developer Tools username and license key. License key is used instead of password in the tool activation window.

These credentials are limited by the duration of early access.

Other than that, please follow [Getting Started](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) documentation.

## Development Status

Active development of features was completed, and currently app is in stabilization state.
And while no more features is planned before the release, any feedback is still welcomed.
And smaller adjustments, improvements can be done.

At the same time, documentation is in process of writing.
First priority is allocated for more advanced scenarios, demonstrating capabilities of the tool.

For the future post-release updates we have several more ideas planned: [DeveloperTools/issues#Features
](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3AFeature)

## Feedback questions

Currently, the most important questions we as developers have are:
1. What do you think about current feature set?
2. Is there any possible reason, why would you prefer old developer tools?
3. Any problems with shortcuts? If any should be redefined or added?
4. What do you think about dark/light color pallete?

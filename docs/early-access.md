# Early Access

## Important Notice

While `Developer Tools` is in preparations for the release, there are several temporary differences from the production state.

Primarily, portal licensing is not available, during the early access period. Requiring several adjustments to `Getting Started` process.

Documentation is temporary private and hosted on [AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools) repository. After the public release, documentation will move to http://docs.avaloniaui.net/ domain.

[AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools) repository itself is currently private. But is going to be main home for change logs, feature requests and bug reports (other than customer specific helpdesk).  

## Setup Changes

Early Access users will receive following credentials:
- NuGet feed username and password. Where login is used as `<YOUR_PORTAL_USERNAME>` and password as `<YOUR_PORTAL_LICENSE_KEY>` from [Step 1: Prepare NuGet feed](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#step-1-prepare-nuget-feed)
- Developer Tools username and license key. License key is used instead of password in the tool activation window.

These credentials are limited by the duration of early access.

Other than that, please follow [Getting Started](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/AvaloniaUI.DeveloperTools/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) documentation.

## Development Status

The application has completed its feature development phase and entered stabilization. No additional features are planned before the release, though minor adjustments and improvements may be implemented based on feedback.

Documentation development is ongoing, with focus on advanced scenarios and tool capabilities.

Future post-release features are tracked here: [DeveloperTools/issues#Features](link)
